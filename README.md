# Christmas Cheer

An experiment into live sentiment analysis of tweets mentioning Christmas

Requirements
 - Node / NPM
 - Gulp
 - MongoDB
 - Heroku

*Notes*

The frontend of this app isn't vaguely tuned for performance. Things like bootstrap and other 3rd party dependencies could be managed more efficiently and brought into the Gulp workflow, with concatenation and minification. It should also go without saying but I/we are not resposible for any content which is displayed - thank Twitter for that.
